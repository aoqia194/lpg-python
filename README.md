## Purpose
This script is for LethalCompany mods on [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/) using [LethalPaintings](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/femboytv/LethalPaintings/) and or [LethalPosters](https://github.com/femboytv/LC_LethalPosters). This generates the formatted images that are used by LethalPaintings and LethalPosters for the game. This is a fork of the original lpg Rust script because I for one do not know Rust enough to maintain the script that is there so I cannot make modifications to it if I wanted, and two because Python is more versatile and the speed is much better.
